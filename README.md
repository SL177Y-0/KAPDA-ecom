This project is an End-to-End E-commerce website for a clothing store, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to browse and shop for various clothing items, manage their cart, and complete purchases with a seamless user experience. The application also provides an admin panel for store owners to manage inventory, view orders, and track sales.
